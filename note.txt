# Issues to be resolved 

1. In 'bike_demand.py', a function is needed to make the pre processing and the mapping of categorical variables

2. In 'index.html', the integer variables need to allow float variable types 
float variable still not allowed after tweaking the html, 'int(x)...' needs to be updated to float(x)      - fixed 

3. In 'index.html', perhaps better formatting for the html file     - partially fixed, more could be done

4. In '...final.ipynb', some more explanations on the outputs of the model and how the model computes the output

5. In '...final.ipynb', check the variables and answer; would any of the variables need further preprocessing? 

6. In 'readme.md', needs a solid write up detailing how the process was developed from data collection, including description of variables to deployment
 - updated structure
